<h1>About Me </h1>

Hello ✨, \
&emsp;My name is Anastasya Duygu Kılıç and I'm a thrid year student in Bilkent University
studying Software Engineering. I always had a passion for learning coding and coming up with projects 
that I would later on bring to life. Currently I aspire to be a project manager because as 
I gather more experience I came to understand that planning a project and leading a team is the field I excel most in.

 &emsp;I'm currently learning R, PHP and node.js.
